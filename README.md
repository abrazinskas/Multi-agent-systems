# Multi-Agent Systems course materials

## Description

This courses focuses on the design and analysis of (multi) agent systems from a logical perspective. This course will be based on Michael Wooldridge’s book: An Introduction to Multi-Agent Systems (Wiley).
The main topics include: goals and intentions, perception-action cycle, action planning, reasoning and search in agents, architectures for agent systems, collaborative agents, communication, and distributed problem solving.
Focus will be on the logical approach to agent systems and on multi-agent settings. The main concepts will be applied to implementations.
The course includes a practical part in which students implement agent systems and perform experiments.
